# **Project Jotaro:**

I want to make a program that have a meaningful conversation with you and responds to different sentences you write. For example if i said " I am sad", it will detect the sadness and say "It takes more muscles to frown than to smile :)". It is also going to play 3 mini games with you that includes doing math, and guessing.
