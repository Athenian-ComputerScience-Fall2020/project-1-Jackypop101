# Project 1

Explain what your project does here.

I want to make a program that have a meaningful conversation with you and responds to different words you write. For example if i said " I am sad", it will detect the sadness and say "It takes more muscles to frown than to smile :)".

Note the following Markdown formatting:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4

*Single asterisks make italics*

**Double asterisks make text bold**

* Asterisk + space before text gives bulleted list
  * Tabbed asterisks give indented lists

`You can make code blocks in a line like this...`

```
...and over 
multiple
lines
like this
```

Use the preview tab at the top to see how it looks. You can edit directly in GitHub or in Gitpod. Be careful not to edit in GitHub while Gitpod is open or you may have version conflicts.
